## How to use?

- Download the [latest binary release](https://github.com/adhumi/Tchou-Tchou/releases/latest) (submission to Mac App Store in progress)
- Drag and drop **Tchou-tchou.app** to the `/Applications` folder
- Run **Tchou-tchou.app**
- Forget about it. The app is running (slowly) in background and will display the speed of your TGV when connected to the WiFi.
